# training_glow_tts
## AIM:
In this task, we first understand how we can infer from pre-trained models in TTS libraries, then we know how we can train our own model using TTS libraries and the requirements for training a model.
## SUMMARY:
In this task, we need to train a text-to-speech model using the GlowTTS model with the Coque TTS library. Currently, I try to train the English language, and after that, we try another language.
## Datasets we will use:
